   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p class="lead">I'm building a staking platform but it will be run as a community project. 
The maximum supply of token = 10 million and the initial token supply = 250 (i.e Two hundred and fifty only). 
The community will crowd fund the project for a total sum of $2,000. 
Members won't contribute more than $10. 
Contributions stop as soon as we raise $,2000. You will have to connect your wallet at <a href="https://caninefarming.com" class="text-success" target="_blank">CanineFarming.com</a> before you can be able to complete transaction if you want to contribute to the project.</p><a href="https://caninefarming." target="_blank" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">Connect</a>

    <h2>How does the staking works?</h2><p>It's assumed there would be two categories of holders in the community.
    The first category are those who plan to earn rewards for holding tokens.
    The second category are those who don't plan to earn rewards for holding tokens.
    To earn rewards for holding tokens, holders need to buy a consumable NFT on the community dapp.
    Consumable NFTs are like to tickets for gaining access to the venue of an event.
    There's no need to buy a consumable NFT as far as the second category is concerned since they don't plan to earn rewards.
    The 250 initial token supply will be shared among members who crowd fund the project and each member will receive a NFT free of charge.
    This qualifies them to earn rewards on their tokens.
    The rewards is up to 400% in APY.
    And tokens stop to earn rewards as soon as all the 10 million tokens are completely minted.</p>

   <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Listing</h2><p>The token will be listed on pancake swap and other DEXs to build volume before approaching centralized exchanges for a listing deal. Also, holders will be able to sell their tokens to new investors or swap it for other tokens.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>How do we develop the ecosystem further, where will the revenue come from?</h2><p>Revenue will be generated from the sales of NFTs.
    The NFTs will have a referral bonus enabled.
    This will serve as a powerful marketing strategy.</p>
